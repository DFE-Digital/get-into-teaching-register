    GCSE stands for General Certificate of Secondary Education. It&apos;s the part of the National Curriculum taught to pupils aged 14 to 16.<br><br>
    The Department for Education does not provide a list of qualifications that can be considered equivalent to GCSEs in English, maths and science. <br><br>
    A training provider will look for evidence that an equivalent qualification:
    <ul>
      <li>meets the standard of GCSE grade 4 (C)</li>
      <li>covers sufficient content</li>
      <li>contains the breadth of content equal to that of a GCSE grade 4 (C)</li>
    </ul>
