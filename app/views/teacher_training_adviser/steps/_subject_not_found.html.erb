        <p>Teacher training advisers can support you if you're returning to teach maths, physics or languages.</p>

        <p>
          If you want to teach a different subject you can still get support by <%= link_to_git_events("attending an online return to teaching event", events_path: "category/online-events") %>
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also <%= link_to("search for a teaching role in England", "https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/") %> and set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.
