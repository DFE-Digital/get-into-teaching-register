        <p>Our teacher training advisers are here to support those returning to teach maths, physics or languages.</p>

        <p>
          We can still offer you support. You can get advice by <%= link_to_git_events("attending an online return to teaching event", events_path: "category/online-events") %>
          or you can <%= link_to("search for a teaching role in England", "https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/") %>.
          You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.
